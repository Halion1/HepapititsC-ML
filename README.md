# Hepatitis C: Statistical Analysis of Risk Factors and Predictive Modeling using Machine Learning

This project involves the statistical analysis of risk factors and the development of predictive models for Hepatitis C using machine learning techniques. The dataset, hepatitisC.csv, contains laboratory values from blood donors and patients suffering from Hepatitis C, along with demographic factors such as age. The data was sourced from Kaggle and collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: UCI HCV Data. Except for the "Category" and "Sex" attributes, all other attributes are numeric. For classification purposes, the target attribute is "Category", with two levels considered: blood donors and Hepatitis C patients (including Hepatitis C, fibrosis, and cirrhosis).

Two articles providing a description of the variables are included in the repository.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to the project!
